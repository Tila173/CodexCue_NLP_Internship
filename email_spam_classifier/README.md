# üåü Email Spam Classifier with Streamlit

This project is an intuitive and visually appealing web application for classifying emails as either **Spam** or **Ham** (Not Spam). The app capitalizes on a trained Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with Word2Vec embeddings to analyze and classify emails based on their content. The application is built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), making it easy to use and accessible via a web interface.

## üöÄ Features

- **Interactive Email Classification**: Users can input email text directly into the app, and the model will predict whether the email is spam or ham. The classification result is displayed with a confidence score in a visually appealing gauge chart.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Alongside classification, the app provides a sentiment analysis of the email content, indicating whether the email has a positive, negative, or neutral tone.
- **Word Cloud Generation**: The app generates a word cloud from the text of previously analyzed emails, offering a visual representation of the most common words.
- **Email Analysis History**: Users can view a history of analyzed emails, including classification results, confidence levels, and sentiment scores.
- **Customizable Themes**: Users can choose between several themes (Light, Dark, Blue, Green, Purple) to personalize the app's appearance.
- **Downloadable Reports**: Users can download the word cloud and a detailed report of the email analysis as text or image files.
- **Contact Information**: An attractive contact section is included for reaching out with inquiries or feedback.
- **Responsive Design**: The app's interface is responsive and visually attractive, adapting well to different screen sizes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the application.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.
