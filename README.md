# CodexCue_NLP_Internship
Join me on my NLP learning journey through this repository. Explore my internship projects, where I've applied NLP concepts to build practical solutions for sentiment analysis, email spam classification, chatbot development, movie recommendation, and keywordÂ extraction.

# NLP Internship Projects:
This repository showcases a collection of natural language processing (NLP) projects I completed during my internship at CodexCue. These projects demonstrate my ability to apply NLP techniques to various real-world tasks.
Projects:
 * Sentiment Analysis: Developed a model to accurately classify the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of text data.
 * Email Spam Classifier: Built a classifier to distinguish between legitimate emails and spam.
 * Chatbot Development: Created a chatbot for customer service, designed to provide informative and helpful responses to user queries.
 * Movie Recommendation System: Implemented a system that recommends movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history.
 * Keyword Extraction: Developed techniques to extract relevant keywords from articles and documents.
# Technologies Used:
 * Python
 * Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
 * TensorFlow
 * Keras
 * Scikit-learn
 * Other relevant libraries as needed
